# Project for Advanced NLP course
We implement a minimal BERT model with an attention mechanism for question-answering tasks. The dataset used is SD-QA (Faisal et al., 2021) which is built on top of TyDi QA (Clark et al., 2020).

The provided project contains the following:

- The PDF report, poster, proposal, and the project's baseline report.
- dialectal-QA-system folder which contains:
  - Code: This directory contains the code
  - Misc: This contains tables for test results and graphs
 
## Instructions to execute the code:
- Kindly modify the input argument output_dir as needed in the run.sh file.
- Execute run.sh to utilize various pre-trained models.
- Run plot.py to create the charts mentioned in the report.
