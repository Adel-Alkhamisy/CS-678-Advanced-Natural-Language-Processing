i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international film festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this as my # 14 film . i had an initial interest in seeing this being of swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the norrland region of sweden where this was filmed . also i grew up in an area of rural north woods america where many small towns were much like the setting of this film . it 's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like så som i himmelen . this was a very bad film and i 'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it 's large ensemble cast and director kay pollock really did not pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing . helen sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was dreary and i no longer look forward to more of her on the big screen . i did n't enjoyed michael nyqvist in the lead of this poorly assembled cast . i would definitely not recommend this film and rate it a 0 on a scale of 10 . ||| 0 ||| 0
this is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just have to get because it just looks so horribly bad . but surprisingly , we love most of it . there was a lot of fast - forwarding going on.<br /><br />but then we came across a scene where robert englund seduces the female protagonist ( her name somehow slips my mind at this time ) . goodness . i 've never watched a single scene from a film so many times ( i 'm estimating forty or so ) . and i 've never laughed so hard in my life . you see , englund has this thing for showing off his loins . i last saw the film a couple months ago , but i ca n't stop laughing as i type . anyway , the scene is a montage of shots-- englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl , englund riding a horse naked , and some mysterious woman fellating a snake 's head . this is absolute genius . you 've got to see it for yourself . ||| 1 ||| 1
do n't get me wrong , i want to see marijuana legalized just as much as the next guy , but the writing here is so realistic that even i believe in a pta mom dealing drugs , but is adamant they not get into the hands of anyone underage .   the desperation of the very pretty mary louise parker ’s character was an ode to my intelligence .   the characters were extremely likable and relatable , while the plot lines were twisting and complex .   i understand it ’s only tv land , but the hypocrisy was handled very subtly .   mary louise parker is a great mom and i believe it .   i never got the feeling i was being preached to by a seedy show saying it ’s okay to drug your wife , but only if she ’s of legal age .   okay , not exactly the same thing , but i think you get my point .   save the children stuff is attention - getting for campaign trails , but it does n’t hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom as the local pot dealer . ||| 1 ||| 1

i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv . i went to tinsel town to see it last night at 7:40 . i was thoroughly pleased with the film . the beginning was a tribute to character development . they pretty much presented the way love works in reality . all of the characters were well cast . the boyfriend was innocent and endearing . the passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having was off color , but hilarious . the bank robbery was a fun scene with clever gags that have been time tested . their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . this made the scene even funnier .    the audience opinion about the movie should be through the roof . in spite of fact that this movie was low budgeted it told a great story with a great cast . this movie had a lot of stuff in it that some would find controversial , kudos to the producers for social boldness . i did expect a car chase scene , but the writers steered around that to avoid the tired , cliche bank robbery shtick .   so i rate this movie an a which stands for awesome , and 9 out of ten stars . ||| 1 ||| 1

this installment very much makes the cia look like a very foolish organization . in reality , perhaps they are . after all , the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill jason bourne.<br /><br />matt damon does a very credible job as bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film . he is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is . he gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film , somebody is trying to kill him.<br /><br />there is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very fake . there are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way adds to the fakeness & makes it seem less professional than many pictures . these sequences add nothing realist to the film in feeling.<br /><br />the suspense in some of the sequences is stupidly done as you know if someone is going to die or if bourne can head them off . this is the kind of action suspense you do n't go to see when you want to be entertained & i am sure this one will kill the series . ||| 0 ||| 0

okay this is gona be short and sweet review ... something the movie took a practice ina nd made its life short and sweet.<br /><br />this movie is $ ^@% . there 's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures all demanding uwe boll make movies from franchises people like . blood rayne being a biggie there.<br /><br />the jokes are good ... even if you 've heard them a thousand times before . the acting is great but u can really only credit the script for that . i even a few moments wonder who wrote the script.<br /><br />the movie has a lot to do with the original games . if you 've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular . there 's so much story for such a movie . like i said . i would even steal this movie . and for the person who says this is ' funniest movie of 2007' .......... need to take a bow , nothing is better than this . ||| 1 ||| 1

i must say , i was disappointed with the quality of the movie . it was far worse than i expected . scenario and acting were quite lousy . the director made a bad job as well . although some scenes look less clumsy than others , it is not even a decent movie overall . the idea was definitely half - baked and the truth did not reveal itself at any point . the mental hospital atmosphere was recreated quite poorly . the plot was unclear , inconsistent and confusing . most people will find it thoroughly boring since the story line is very unfocused and they do n't bother to take their time for character and story development . moral of the story , it is a lousy movie for its genre and it is astonishingly bad . ||| 0 ||| 0
a new way to dislike goldsworthy 's work , rivers and tides does n't allow fans to see his work in motion . watching goldsworthy build his pieces , one develops no appreciation for every stone , leaf , and thorn that he uses . goldsworthy describes how the flow of life , the rivers , and the tides inspires and affects his work . although , i was unhappy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy 's pieces ( no snowballs ) , i do feel it was a bit long . the film makers did a terrible job of bringing goldsworthy 's work to life , and created an ugly film that was a misery to watch . ||| 0 ||| 0
brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down . we expect a lot more from our movies these days , so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20 's were a bit more innocent . william haines is n't charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and , even , glory . all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted especially the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford , the town nerd . the movie lacks everything , romance , tears , love , death , and even sports ... it 's a poor education in how society has changed in the 20th century . ||| 0 ||| 0

the reason this is such a good movie is because it is so well written , and this is entirely to the credit of the incredible novelist robert james waller , also author of bridges of madison county . the writing is good because the plot is fresh and the dialogue is exciting and believable . a succeeding couplea blocked american writer and a pretty mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong , self - directed criminal , and after a few adventures ( mostly terrifically violent ) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin , she leaves the impotent partner for the killer , who , bad as he is , sees her more clearly than anyone has before . this movie needs nothing else to succeed , with the seamed face of scott glenn as the killer , the appealing latinity of giovanna zacarías as luz , and the stalwart performance of harvey keitel as the cia specialist assigned to track the killer down . a seriously good use of time . ||| 1 ||| 1

johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories . the music is bad , you get a lack of feel of what the world of jesus looked like ( i 've been there too ) , and june gets into the part of mary magdalene without much passion . cash 's narration is bad too.<br /><br />but .... <br /><br />1 . the actor who played jesus was miscast . 2 . there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music . 3 . because it is uncompelling , i doubt we 'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />i'd never consider buying the cd.<br /><br />tom paine texas , usa ||| 0 ||| 0

i researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii greenwich village world of gays and lesbians . with the exception of stewart and novak , the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle . john van druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this greenwich village . i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell , book and candle in the theater when i was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me . it was hard to get me to a movie that did n't include horses , machine guns , or alien monsters and i planned on being bored . i remember the moment when jimmy stewart embraced kim novak on the top of the flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground . as the ridiculous george duning love theme soared , i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall out of love . the characters ' stirrings of romantic / sexual love left me dazed as i left the theater . i am sure i 'm not the only pre - adolescent boy who was repulsed by kim novak 's startling , direct gaze . it 's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump - start heterosexual puberty in so many of us . i am in my late 50 's now and re - watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later . . . ||| 0 ||| 0

i loved this show when i was a kid . that was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents , not just the different general american dialect we 're used to . jack wild had a british accent and pufnstuf 's was southern . like one of the others mentioned , though , i never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute . that always seemed odd to me , probably because the flute just annoyed me and i would n't have gone to any trouble to take it away!<br /><br />just a comment on the similarity of pufnstuf to early 70s mcdonalds commercials that others have mentioned : pufnstuf did not rip off mcdonalds . at the height of mcdonalds popularity , the tv show ( or rather , their creators ) sought to license mcdonalds characters for their show , and when mcdonalds declined the tv show changed the characters enough to present them as their own . okay , so they hired former employees of mcdonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the tv shows , and mcdonalds sued and won . search for pufnstuf mcdonaldland lawsuit and you 'll find plenty of articles about it . ||| 1 ||| 1

do not watch this movie if you hated the classics such as tom wopat , john schneider , catherine bach , sorrell booke , james best , denver pyle , sonny shroyer , and ben jones ! this movie will not dissappoint you ! first of all , this movie starts out with bo and luke running moonshine for jesse . bo and luke would do that for sure on the real series ! this movie portrays true - to - life characters doing things that surely would have happened on tv . in the series , uncle jesse was dishonest , and law - breaking . in this movie , he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of georgia . plus , if this was an extension adding on to the dukes of hazzard reunion ! and the dukes of hazzard in hollywood , you might question : how could uncle jesse be making moonshine when he died before the dukes of hazzard in hollywood movie ? and how is boss hogg alive when he died before the reunion movie in 1997 ! movie and rosco ran hazzard ? it seems magical that these characters came back to life , when they have been dead for 11 and 8 years ?   answer : because it 's not a continuation ! it did n't feature the elderly   james best , john schneider , tom wopat , ben jones , and catherine bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 . they made a new family friendly movie without the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is especially in this playful , gut - splitting movie ! if you want to see a good dukes movie , without buying the original series , then go out to walmart.com and buy the dvd of this updated release ! it does n't star the original cast , but it 's family friendly ! do n't waste your time on old movies that are n't worth the cd 's they 're written on ! ||| 1 ||| 1
things to come is indeed a terrible work of speculative fiction ; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress . it makes some surprising inaccurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later , but is woefully naive in it 's utopian ideals . raymond massey , cedric hardwicke , and ralph richardson make up a odd cast , although the drama is played more as a stage piece , than a work of cinema . there are grandiose , if somewhat stilted speeches , often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater . and , there are somenasty words there . is technology the savior of mankind , or the instrument of its destruction ? the film is a visual terror , if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects . sure , hollywood is more sophisticated today , but rarely as lame . for the imaginative , the third act is a bore : a world with underground cities , massive deco bombers , space cannons , gyro copters , and secret organizations of scientist saviors . it has all of the makings of a sci - fi pulp adventure , but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise . things to come and metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic hollywood science fiction cinema . they are operatic in scope , and visually terrifying . technology has long left them behind , but their ideas still burst forth . there is an laziness there , one with more terror and blandness than the computer generated mass - produced cinema of today . these films are the products of losers , not winners . ||| 0 ||| 0

the magnetism radiated from elvira , drawing her legions of devoted admirers , has a primordial quality . with her lengthy , well - toned figure , large - bust , innocuously mischievous attitude and grab - bag lexicon of me - generation valley slang , the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal . as an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling , it is evident that the elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one - liners and large chest . as initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her , she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level : a strange mixture of one - dimensional romantic yearning , boyish sexual craving and the desire for non - threateningly lighthearted fun . she symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town . the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons . in the end , however , her film can not move pass its more campy ingredients . the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting , her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents . nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy , only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense . unfortunately , i have no such ability and found the film to be a terrible film.<br /><br />best quote : bob redding : how 's your head ? elvira : i have n't had any complaints . ||| 0 ||| 0

""" well , what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation?<br /><br />there are some amazing actors in this ( oliver reed , sarah miles , christopher plummer ) but they clearly are clocking up the money.<br /><br />lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics - anthony with hugh grant ( who looks particularly good ) and gilbert with helena bonham carter.<br /><br />if you really want to see a "" "" watchable "" "" adaptation of cartland , the bonham carter one is the one to go for ( "" "" a hazard of hearts "" "" - what a title ! ! ) . gilbert is the strong link in that and bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act well , and the rest of the cast play it well to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek ( edward fox & diana rigg ) """ ||| 1 ||| 1

""" i 'm a great admirer of lon chaney , but the screen writing of this movie did work for me . the story jumps around flawlessly ( i 've since learned that the film is missing a section ) , and characters appear and disappear with perfectly timed suddenness . some of the intertitles are finely explanatory ( e.g. , "" "" why , you 're not a child anymore!""""--cut back to picture for a long , slow beat--""""you're a woman ! "" "" yes , we got it the first time ) but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that always appear . ( let 's hear luigi and his blond girlfriend 's argument , please ! ) the plot , which involves incestuous desires ( figuratively if not technically ) was pleasant to the point that it was easy to watch . to the writer 's credit , this issue was treated as a problem , and a may - december match is not portrayed as the right - and - good inevitability of some mary pickford films ( e.g. , "" "" daddy - long - legs "" "" ) . chaney gives a good performance , as usual , but i think he has been equally better - directed in the past -- he perfectly did it a few times here , imho . i did enjoy the clown sequences , and was very impressed at the stunts . loretta young was charming , though astonishingly young . the film has its moments , but so far , it 's my favorite chaney picture .

""" one of the most time consuming and lazy documentaries , you 'll ever watch . while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas , it provides a boring look into political dynamics , that fail throughout the western hemisphere . while essentially another chapter in the story of the "" "" u.s. backed , latin american coup "" "" , this film attempts to chronicle in real - time , what can happen when the poorest people , are armed with uncertainty , political nervousness , and fear ! < br /><br />the political insights offered by this film are invaluable in that they have no value . one gets hazy examples of the private media , as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda . we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of "" "" american politics "" "" . one gets a vague sense of impending doom , if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny , which has been abruptly , and illegally , thrust upon them by the conspirators . we also see the arrogance and fascism , of the cia backed , private media , plutocrats , and generals , who 've conspired to bring venezuela back under washington 's domination . though ably led by president hugo chavez , the people of caracas are forced to act without him , after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals . their response is another low point of the film . if one seeks a poor portrait of what the u.s. government , hugo chavez , and revolutionary venezuela , are all about , this movie is it !

from the very beginning , the political theme of this film is so subtle and even handed , that the outcome is entirely unpredictable . any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters , incorporating character arcs , and three act structure . in this film you will find all of that . the police are the baddies , and consequently are shown as shallow , incompetent and cowards . this was not a situation where they were   honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain . the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse , but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence . we see him walk through the door of a gaol , but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression . i found the film intriguing to watch . it is the direction for modern films , and this one tempts me to watch more . ||| 1 ||| 1

a slight , charming little movie to be sure , but a poorly - crafted one . gwyneth paltrow fails in this early showcase for her british accent , and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue . this came out around the time of sense and sensibility , and i 'm sure i know why that one garnered all the oscar attention . emma is jane austen 's least accessible and most stuffy story , told well . ||| 0 ||| 0
